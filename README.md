# multithreaded_deadlock
Project 2 - CMPSC 473

## Project Overview

### Discription
1. Create a multithreaded program that deadlocks.
2. Demonstrate each of the four classes of strategies to eliminated deadlock (remember, each
strategy focuses on one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock. You are to demonstrate each of these four solutions by starting with your deadlocking program from part 1, and modifying your code to demonstrate the strategy.
  a. Write a brief explanation of the necessary condition for deadlock the strategy eliminates, and *clearly* explain how your code implements the strategy.


### Requirements:
You MUST use C++ 11 or later standard threads in your work. Use of mutexes are required, std::mutex highly recommended.

## WHAT TO SUBMIT:
Your source code and any header files you create are required. You must also submit Visual Studio project/solution files (if you’re using VS) or makefiles (if you’re using linux).
You MUST demonstrate the functionality of your code to the TAs.


## This Project

My project is based out of an Xcode project in C++. If you want to use this in Visual Studio just put all .cpp and .h file in a Visual Studio project.
